# BrailleToTextDecoderWithAudio
A Braille image to text decoder is a computer program that translates images  containing Braille characters into readable text, audio for individuals who are blind/visually impaired. The system uses image processing techniques to recognize the  Braille characters and convert them into text. I have used Connected component Analysis (8 connectivity).
